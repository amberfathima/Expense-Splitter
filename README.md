# Expense Splitter (Python Tkinter GUI)

A simple and aesthetic **Expense Splitter App** built using Python’s `tkinter`.  
It helps you easily divide shared expenses among friends, track who owes whom, and view balances — all in a clean pastel interface 

---

## Features
-  Add shared expenses with payer and participants  
-  Automatically splits the cost evenly  
-  View balances instantly  
-  Alerts for missing or invalid inputs  
-  Cute pastel GUI (student aesthetic)

---

## How It Works
When someone pays for a group:
- The **payer** gets credit for the full amount.
- The **participants** each owe their equal share.
- Balances update automatically — so you can see who owes or is owed.

Example:
```
Amber pays ₹120 for Amber, Insiya, and Anshika
→ Amber is owed ₹80
→ Insiya owes ₹40
→ Anshika owes ₹40
```
